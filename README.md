**Investigating hierarchal control amongst functional networks disrupted by opioid use disorder using effective connectivity analysis.**

This repository contains the code for the statistical tests and algorithm described in the paper "Investigating hierarchal control amongst functional networks disrupted by opioid use disorder using effective connectivity". The paper is linked here: [Link"] 
Please cite this work should you use any part of this code.

 **Dependencies**

In order to run the statistical experiments and algorithm as done in the paper, your environment will need to contains the following main packages:

- pandas 2.0.1
- numpy 1.24.4
- scipy 1.8.0


**Large scale non-linear granger causality (LsNGC)**

Large scale non-linear granger causality (LsNGC) was used for the effective connectivity analysis.
LsNGC was developed by WismÃ¼ller et al (2021), with a full repository of the original analysis and code for lsNGC here: https://github.com/Large-scale-causality-inference/Large-scale-nonlinear-causality

After, a clustering model was created to investigate whether effective connectivity patterns are able to characterise healthy controls and people with opioid use disorder.


This pipeline utilizes data from 22 healthy controls and 25 methadone dependent patients from the Neural Correlates of Opioid Dependence (NCORE) study [1].
Each subject performed the Monetary Incentive Delay and Cue Reactivity task duroing functional magnetic resonance imaging acuqistion.
Timeseries of task activity were extracted from each region of the AAL2 atlas from each subject, and there are functions in this repository to format the extracted timeseries for use in effective connectivity analysis.

1. Make sure your timeseries are in a CSV format. For these analyses, each subject had a 214-by-214 CSV.
2. Ensure all the CSVs used for the EC are in the correct directory
3. Run the LsNGC analysis script
4. Save the Affinity matricies and f-statistic
5. Run the EC Permutation test.
6. Run the EdgeCountsAndDigraph script
   i. Evaluate the dominant network of influence
   ii. Visualise the edge counts across each network for both conditions, HC>MD and MD>HC.
7. Run the UMAPandHDBSCAN script
   i. Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP).
   ii. Perform Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN).
   iii. Evaluate the cluster profiling, and seperation.
   iv. Evaluate the features important for distinguishing and seperating clusters.
   v. Evaluate the noise point cluster, whether the noise points are boundaries or transitional in relation to the main clusters.


**For lsNGC:**
- The functions for lsNGC can be found in the lsNGC functions folder, and these can also be found by the original authors here: https://github.com/Large-scale-causality-inference/Large-scale-nonlinear-causality
- After, the lsNGC analysis script and the functions downloaded, can be run locally.
