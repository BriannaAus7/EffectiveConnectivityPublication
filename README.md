**Investigating hierarchal control amongst functional networks disrupted by opioid use disorder using effective connectivity analysis.**

This repository contains the code for the statistical tests and algorithm described in the paper "Investigating hierarchal control amongst functional networks disrupted by opioid use disorder using effective connectivity". The paper is linked here: [Link"] 
Please cite this work should you use any part of this code.

 **Dependencies**

In order to run the statistical experiments and algorithm as done in the paper, your environment will need to contains the following main packages:

- pandas 2.0.1
- numpy 1.24.4
- scipy 1.8.0


**Large scale non-linear granger causality (LsNGC)**
Large scale non-linear granger causality (LsNGC) was used for the effective connectivity analysis.
LsNGC was developed by Wism√ºller et al (2021), with a full repository of the original analysis and code for lsNGC here: https://github.com/Large-scale-causality-inference/Large-scale-nonlinear-causality

After, a clustering model was created to investigate whether effective connectivity patterns are able to characterise healthy controls and people with opioid use disorder.
